[Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-build-an-api-from-scratch/)

This week I wanted to discuss how to build an API. Similar to alot of the projects we have worked on throughout this degree, GeeksforGeeks has quite a few resources on the topics we talk about. One that I found interesting was the listed above article that completely covers API Development and Scalability. It talks about how you want to define the purpose first before going into your methods. This is useful and really beats the nail down about what we have been learning about as well. 

I also did not know there was so many methods for creating API and the different coding enviroments. It really is important to branch out and find the process that works best for each developer!
